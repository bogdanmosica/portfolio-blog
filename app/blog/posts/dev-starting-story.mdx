In 2017, I was working in sales, a career that was comfortable but not entirely fulfilling. My turning point came when I was working with Excel. I kept thinking, there has to be a better and easier way to do this. That curiosity led me to discover front-end development, and little did I know that this path would change my life.

## Taking the First Step

Determined to explore this new world, I enrolled in a six-month, in-person programming course in my local town. It was challenging at first—I had no prior experience in coding. The concepts felt overwhelming, and many times, I doubted myself. There were moments when I thought I was going nowhere, feeling like I wasn’t making any real progress. I even questioned if I was smart enough for this field. Impostor syndrome was real, and it still creeps in from time to time.

However, I found motivation in reading stories of people who had transitioned into tech without a Computer Science degree. If they could do it, so could I. My biggest driving force, though, was my kids—I had to make it for them.

## The Real Challenges Begin

After completing the course, I was eager to get hired. But breaking into the industry was tough. I started my career as a software tester, a role that wasn’t exactly what I had envisioned, but it was a step into the tech world. About a year later, a front-end developer position opened up in my company, and I seized the opportunity.

One of the hardest challenges came when I landed my first real big project. That was when I truly realized—I knew nothing. The learning curve was steep, and every task felt like a mountain to climb. However, with relentless practice and patience, I pushed through. Over time, everything started making more sense. With each “Eureka!” moment, my confidence grew, and I felt more capable than ever.

Since then, I’ve worked on multiple projects, including volunteer ones, each teaching me something new. Every project is unique, and that’s what keeps programming exciting.

## Tips for Aspiring Developers

Looking back, here are three things I would tell anyone starting out:

- Never give up. The road will seem dark, and progress might feel slow, but trust the process. Eventually, you will see the light at the end of the tunnel.

- Practice relentlessly. You can read all the theory in the world, but nothing beats hands-on coding. Practice is the mother of all learning.

- Stay humble. No matter how much you think you know, there’s always someone smarter. Be open to learning from everyone—whether in interviews, at work, or within the developer community.

## Final Thoughts

The journey from sales to software development wasn’t easy. It was filled with doubts, setbacks, and countless hours of learning. But looking back, I wouldn’t change a thing. The struggles made the victories even sweeter, and the challenges turned into stepping stones.

If you’re thinking about making a career switch into programming, know that it’s possible. Keep pushing forward, keep learning, and most importantly—believe in yourself. The road might be harsh, but the results are worth it.
